# web_painting
A web based application that will randomly assign a player an element (Clouds, Wind, Dirt, or Birds) when the page loads, and allow them to draw these elements on a shared canvas

The elements interact with each other in the following ways:

- Rain Clouds -> Water dirt and grow grass
- Wind -> Blows rain clouds
- Birds -> Look cool

## To Use

1. Clone git repo
2. run `npm install`
3. to start run `npm start` which will start a local application on port 3000
